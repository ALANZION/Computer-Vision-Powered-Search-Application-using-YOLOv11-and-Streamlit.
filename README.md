# Computer-Vision-Powered-Search-Application-using-YOLOv11-and-Streamlit.

## Aim
To design and develop a Computer Vision Powered Search Application that utilizes deep learning (YOLOv11) to index local image repositories, detect objects within images, and enable users to perform semantic searches (e.g., finding all images containing a "truck" or "person") through an interactive web-based dashboard.
